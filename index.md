# Welcome to my GitHub Page!

Hi dear Reader! 

I'm Carlos Sanchez and I'm very pleased that you landed on this page! 

On the following couple of lines you'll find my personal achievements, past experience and personal projects (you can consider this a resume for the sake of simplicity.

## About me

I'm a Software engineer in test with 5+ years of experience in developing test harness and applications from scratch.

My professional achievements include:
* Decreased the time spent running regression by 80% by adding automated test cases with just a click in the CI Job on Jekins with no human input needed; results upfront in a couple of minutes.
* Created various test harness for different teams. Found the best solution for each team, whether it was UI/API or any other sort of tests they needed, in order to achieve the testing of its applications.
* Implemented CI/CD in various projects to monitor the health of our app, and to decrease running times and ensure no impact was made on the side of the application.
* Improved project testing practices on what to do and what not to do from the testing side. 
* Speaker in behalf for new technologies in the software development field.
* Volunteer for evaluating skills and knowledge of new candidates (interviewer).

## Interesting Stuff I made!

### [Link Shortener](https://less-lnk.herokuapp.com/) :computer:
A web application written using Meteor, Mongo, Node and React -> this application is a link shrortener and will even count the tiems that you visited the link and if you share it with someone else, you will also know if they have visitied too as it tracks visits. [And the code for that app here!](https://github.com/carlosesh/Lnk-Shortner)

### [Buy/Sell Stocks](https://github.com/carlosesh/finance) :dollar:
A web application written in python + flask + javascript. This application let's you buy stocks and sell them with real time values, it will also store your transaction history!

### [Forensic Image Recovery](https://github.com/carlosesh/cs50/blob/master/pset4/recover/recover.c) :mag:
My own implementation of forensic image recovery, the only thing you need is the raw file from your card and it will recover every image that has been "deleted" in reality the image is not deleted, what happens is that those bits are not accessible any longer, so the next time you take photos it just overwrites those already occupied spaces in memory with your new image, but if you just deleted your photos and you want all of them back, just use my implementation from [here](https://github.com/carlosesh/cs50/blob/master/pset4/recover/recover.c)

### [Speller](https://github.com/carlosesh/cs50/tree/master/pset5/speller) :page_facing_up:
An speller *(seriously?)* program which checks whole scripts, like a movie script that you wrote to present it to someone, or poem, or anything at all! Just give it some text and a bigger dictionary if you desire. and In a matter of seconds it will go through it all and tell you your mistakes.

### [DNA checker](https://github.com/carlosesh/cs50/tree/master/pset6/dna) :syringe:
Assume you have received a sample of DNA and you calculate the nucleotid chains contained in the dNA, once you have that you need to compare against a set of existing results to see if there's a match, well, this is doing that, this actually how forensics match your DNA against a existing data for any number of purposes.

### [Score Keeper](https://github.com/carlosesh/Lnk-Shortner) :soccer:
An application which you can feed different participants and their respective rank according to their respective points. Pretty easy, was one of my first adventures in development.

### [Galen Framework](https://github.com/carlosesh/JUnit-GalenFramework)
This is just basically my playground to try different stuff related to testing frameworks.
